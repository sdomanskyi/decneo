# Data 

## PCN.txt

The given ``PCN.txt`` file holds a **parsimonious composite network** of 19781 nodes and 2724724 edges.

Huang JK*, Carlin DE*, Yu MK, Zhang W, Kreisberg JF, Tamayo P, Ideker T. (2018). 
Systematic Evaluation of Molecular Networks for Discovery of 
Disease Genes. Cell Systems. 4 (6): 484-495.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.001

The PCN is called PCNet in the original work by Huang et al. PCNet was downloaded from the Network Data Exchange (NDEx)
(Pillich et al., 2017, Pratt et al., 2015) at https://goo.gl/WVDznR. 
Specifically, the downloaded file is "Parsimonious Composite Network (PCNet).cx" (134Mb).
The network edges were extracted and a simple representation "PCN.txt" was retained 
for our analysis.

The file "PCN.txt" is required by the analysis pipeline to calculate binomial enrichment 
probability for the resulting binomial information panel.
