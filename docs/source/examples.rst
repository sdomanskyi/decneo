Download file ``VoightChoroid4567RemappedData.h5`` (456.7 Mb) 
from https://zenodo.org/ which 
contains normalized gene expression of **27504** genes of **7996** endothelial 
cells from **8** batches, 
and **5704** non-endothelial cells from **8** batches. Genes that are not expressed in 
endothelial cells are removed from non-endothelial cells dataset.

Save the downloaded data file to ``demo/``, or otherwise modify path in ``demoData`` of
