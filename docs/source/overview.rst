**Overview**
============

In silico detection of transcriptional regulation genes from single cell transcriptomics.

**Description of the package functionality**
--------------------------------------------

1. **Calculate gene expression distance of single cell RNA sequencing data from two different species**
2. **Prepare "all" case and bootstrap cases**
3. **Comparison and analyze pairs of cases from the two different species**
4. **Build and plot dendrogram, heatmap, and bargraphs for these cases**
5. **Analyze the combination of measurements**
6. **Randomize the dendrogram of "all" case to determine the frequency of each gene being in the largest peak**
